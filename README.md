# EmotionSense
EmotionSense is a deep learning-based facial emotion recognition system that classifies human emotions from images using a CNN model and a simple Tkinter GUI. It detects 7 basic emotions including Happy, Sad, Angry, and more.

# 😃 EmotionSense

**EmotionSense** is a deep learning-based facial emotion recognition system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify human emotions from grayscale facial images. It features a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter that allows users to upload an image and instantly detect the displayed emotion.

## 📌 Features

- Built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Detects 7 basic emotions from facial images
- Interactive GUI using Tkinter (upload and detect)
- Trained and tested on grayscale 48x48 emotion dataset
- Model and weights saved separately for modular loading
- Fully implemented in Python using TensorFlow and OpenCV

## 🧠 Detected Emotions

The model can classify one of the following seven emotions:

- 😠 Angry  
- 🤢 Disgust  
- 😨 Fear  
- 😄 Happy  
- 😐 Neutral  
- 😢 Sad  
- 😲 Surprise

## Using the App
1. Launch the GUI window.
2. Click "Upload Image" to select a face image from your system.
3. Click "Detect Emotion" to get the predicted emotion.
4. The emotion will be displayed below the image.
